shendralar.1.d:0 "Our beautiful city has been laying in ruins for now centuries. It was once a shinning beacon of the Highborne Empire under the magnificent rule of our Queen Azshara, it was a prime example of our excellence and home to the biggest collection of books, librams and scrolls holding the greatest arcanic knowledge of the empire. \n With our numbers dwindling the past few years, parts of the city have been slowly abandonned and left to be overrun by wildlife. But it is now time for us to retake our great city and liberate it from the mischevious forces that now dweels within its walls. The first thing we did was to..."
shendralar.1.option.1:0 "...refurbish the workshops."
shendralar.1.option.2:0 "...fire up the forges."

shendralar.2.d:0 "The east part of the ruins known the Warpwood Quarter have been home to the Wildspawn Satyrs for quite a while now. While the satyrs are generally infamous for being a bestial, violent and manipulative race, in the end, they are still our fellow bretherns that are suffering from the Curse of Xavius. Maybe we can set aside the mistakes of the past and work together to revive our glorious city?"
shendralar.2.option.1:0 "Purge these demonic abominations out of our city!"

shendralar.8.t:0 "The Shen'dralar"
shendralar.8.d:0 "We, the Shen'dralar (meaning "Those who Remain Hidden"), were once the greatest arcanists of our beloved Queen Azshara during the time of the Kaldorei Empire. It was our most important responsability to safekeep her tomes and scrolls of arcane magic within the walls of our magnificent city: Eldre'thalas. Absolutely loyal to our monarch, we obeyed every of her orders, even the most secretive ones. During the Sundering, we managed to defend the city against the wave of demons invading Azeroth, but this was only the beggining of our troubles..."
shendralar.8.option.1:0 "The Sundering was only the beggining."

shendralar.9.t:0 "The Cost of Immortality"
shendralar.9.d:0 "When the Well of Eternity exploded some ten thousands years ago, we were deprived from its powerful and addictive power, but most importantly, the loss of the Well was also the loss of our immortality. The following years were marked with lethargy and withering of our powers, until the day where our prince, Tortheldrin, formulated a plan to revitalize us. Within the great halls of the western wing of Eldre'thalas, our great city, he forged pylons to enact a forcefield and within it, summoned and emprisonned a great demon: Immol'thar. \n\nFrom him, we started siphonning power, a power far more addictive and potent that the one the Well used to provide. But has years, century and millenia passed, the cost to sustain the forcefield slowly grew to the point where it was impossible to maintain the prison AND feed powers to all of our population. desperate to regain the energies of the demon, Prince Tortheldrin resolved to a grim solution: killing our brethrens. Less people meant less power needed to sustain everyone. This worked for a while, and Tortheldrin and his loyalists kept killing more and more. But the cost to keep the demon enclosed within its arcanic walls kept growing. \n\nNow, our arcanists estimate that at this rate, the prison will fail and the demon will be freed and unleash its rage upon us in around 1 year. We have to act quickly if we want to remain safe and fed with energies."
shendralar.9.option.1:0 "Something must be done, and quick."
shendralar.9.option.1.d:0 "§RIf we don't do anything, Immol'thar will be set free in one year!§!§G \nWe can try our best to postpone it by enacting §!§HDemonic Containment§!§G decisions in the decision tab.§!"

shendralar.10.t:0 "Internal Divisions"
shendralar.10.d:0 "While most us manage to sustain our inherent addiction to magic, a minority doesn't feel satisfied enough by the current amount drained from Immol'thar. Highly addicted to its potent volatile energies, they have banded together and started what looks like some kind of cult dedicated to the demon within the prison. A small portion of them go as far as sabotaging the arcanic prison wishing for Immol'thar to be released. Worst, some among their ranks are willing to find a way to seal a pact with the Burning Legion to gain access to the almost unlimited, yet extremely dangerous, power of Fel Magic... \n\nThis division is even present within the court of the Prince himself and some of its member have become more dependant on the demonic energies as well and show sympathies to the cult. Today this division became proeminent when the court was assembled to debate our combat tactics. The cultist minority wish to use the energies to their maximum potential to fuel powerful and destructive spells, while the majority of our arcanists prefere to keep our current tactics of defense by conjuring defensive spells. Prince Tortheldrin on the other hand, told the assembly that a well trained and ready arcanist is a victorious arcanists. In the end, the choice was for him to decide."
shendralar.10.option.1:0 "The cultists do have a point."
shendralar.10.option.2:0 "Our defensive tactics have worked so far."
shendralar.10.option.3:0 "Like I said, training and readyness is key to victory."

shendralar.11.t:0 "Azshara's Greatest Arcanists"
shendralar.11.d:0 "Before the Sundering, we used to be the greatest arcanists in the whole Kaldorei Empire to the point of being the most revered magic wielders of Her Majesty Queen Azshara herself. We were charged of safekeeping the most precious books, tomes and knowledge of the whole empire!\n\n Even though the Sundering occured some ten thousands years ago and that we have sadly lost much of our glory, our skill and knowledge did not falter, and in fact, many books and tomes still reside within the city to this day, yet to be found.\n\n Recently the topic of making good use of all this knowledge has been put on the table: the majority of the Court wish to bolster while the cultists want to train our mages to improve our use of magic. Finally, a small portions of the Prince's advisors proposed to strengthen the spell keeping Immol'thar's prison working."
shendralar.11.option.1:0 "Let's improve our research."
shendralar.11.option.2:0 "Our mages need that knowledge."
shendralar.11.option.3:0 "We need buy time."
