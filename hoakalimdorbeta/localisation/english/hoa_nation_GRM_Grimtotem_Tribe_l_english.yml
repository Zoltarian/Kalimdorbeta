And that because we have for long left the peaceful ways of our other tauren brothers, only with strength shall we eradicate the lesser races from our rightful lands within Kalimdor. \n\n This martial tradition has been part of the Grimtotem tribe for generation and has allowed us to survive and expand where other foolish tribes have fell to threats like the horrendous centaurs. Our leader, Magatha Grimtotem is making sure of that, for she is upholding these traditions with great value and wish to continue to do so. But while her ideas might be shared by the majority of our tribe, others, led by the mighty Jevan Grimtotem think otherwise. Despites his loyalty to Magatha, he find some of her cunning actions to be betrayals against the shamaning ways, which is regards with almost complete zeal. Jevan seeks to lead the Grimtotem back to their tradtionnal way of life of peacefulness and cooperation between tribes while still retaining the strength that make the tribe what it is today. \n\n The destiny of the Grimtotem is to be a great one, but how it will mark the history of taurenkind entirely depends on who shall lead it..."
