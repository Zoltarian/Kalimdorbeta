 POLITICS_KING_LLANE_WYRNN_DESC:0 "King Llane Wrynn was born the Prince of Stormwind, son of King Barathen, where he grew up alongside Medivh. Despite being a mischevious child, the Kingdom of Stormwind adored Prince Llane. While his friend Medivh was in a coma, Llane had been prepared to take his father's throne when it was necessary, while his other friend, Anduin Lothar, became a Knight of Stormwind. However, when the Gurubashi Tribes had begun attacking Stormwind's territory, his father preferred a more peaceful approach, while Prince Llane wanted to invade the Gurubashi Tribes to the south. Medivh, Llane, and Lothar infiltrated Gurubashi lands and slayed their leader, Jok'non. Later, Llane and his people had to defend Stormwind from the Gurubashi counter-attack who had united the Tribes and marched to Stormwind itself. Llane's father launched a counter-attack which cost him his life. After his father's death, Prince Llane was crowned King of Stormwind. "
 POLITICS_REGENT_LORD_ANDUIN_LOTHAR_DESC:0 "Anduin Lothar was the last true descendant of the Arathi bloodline. A Knight-Champion whose renown spread through the Eastern Kingdoms, he was known as the "Lion of Stormwind" and one of the closest friends to King Llane Wrynn and the Last Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh."

Over time however, these efforts have also made it clear that our nation cannot afford to subsidize both the development of the city and the countryside at the same time. As such we must make a difficult choice between repairing the city and repairing the countryside. Repairing the city would take less time and could provide a strong economical backbone off of which we could further subsidize the countryside in the future, yet it would hinder the exploitation of important resources and establishing a strong and reliable industry across the kingdom."

These soldiers have reported finding a corpse of a large green creature that they don’t recognize. While this is likely local gossip to cover up Bandits or Gnolls, perhaps we should send more troops to Stonewatch Keep to watch over the villages in Redridge."
