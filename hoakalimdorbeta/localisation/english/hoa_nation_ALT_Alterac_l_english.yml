POLITICS_AIDEN_PERENOLDE_DESC:0 "Despite the small size of his empire, Aiden Perenold rules righteously and wisely over his kingdom. As king, Perenold vowed to assist his country and his subjects in grim times and do everything in his power to ensure their safety. Aiden grew accustomed, yet cultivated, in a rich household. As a patriot through and through, like most people in Alterac, he loves his homeland. Blinded by his envy, he despises Lordaeron and its capital in secret. He would do anything for his homeland, even if it meant sacrificing his honor."
