POLITICS_DUROTAN_DESC:0 "The youngest son of Garad, his rise to chieftain is a tale of woe. His eldest brother unbeknownst to his clan abandoned them taking on the name Fenris and now leads the rival Thunderlords, his elder brother Ga’nar was killed in the battle of Bladespire Hold and his father fell victim to the Red Pox epidemic spawned by Gul’dan. He is the embodiment of the morals the Frostwolves stand for: community, family, honor, and harmony. He is the last surviving chieftain who holds critical views of Gul’dan, and the actions taken against the Draenei and stood idly by as his home slowly wasted away through the use of Fel magic. One of the few Orcs to have not drank the blood of Manorath, Durotan forbade his clan to do so, Making the frostwolf seen a weak clan by many Orcs. While begrudgingly following the Horde, Durotan has sacrificed morals and beliefs for the betterment of his clan, following the Horde into Azeroth to find a new home for his clan, and his unborn son, Knowing Gul’dan is scheming his demise."
POLITICS_DREKTHAR_DESC:0 "Farseer, Elder Shaman and reluctant Chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan after the passing of Durotan and Draka. When the Shamans of Draenor lost connection to the Elements Drek’thar underwent the teachings of Fel Magic under Gul'dan's Shadow Council and committed many atrocities to the Draenei people while being corrupted by these magics, though when arriving on Azeroth he felt the presence of the elements again and renounced the corrupting influence of Fel Magic and embraced the old shamanistic ways and through this embrace was able to get aid of the white wolves of the mountains to their aid after the deaths of the frost wolves back on Draenor. Repentful for his actions and now having the role of leadership forced onto him, he leads his people in harsh and meager conditions in the Alterac mountains hoping to escape the ire of both Horde and Alliance alike."
