POLITICS_KILROGG_DEADEYE_DESC:0 "Born to the then fleeting clan of the bleeding hollow in the savage Tanaan jungles, Kilrogg, on behest of his father, did an ancient clan sacrifice sacrificing his left eye to receive a vision of the future. He saw his clan rising to greatness again and he foresaw his own death. After this vision he killed his father and took over the roll as Chieftain and leads them fearlessly into any situation knowing that the moment of his death wouldn’t be that one. Now as one of the oldest living chieftains he leads the Bleeding Hollow following the Horde trying to claim an area that is similar to their home of the Tanaan Jungle."
