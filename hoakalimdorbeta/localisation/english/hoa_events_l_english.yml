 stormwind_capitulation.102.option.1:0 "And we will hold until the reinforcements come. As long as men with stout hearts are manning the walls and the throne, Stormwind will hold."

 stormwind_capitulation.301.t:0 "[STO.GetName] begs for help"
 stormwind_capitulation.301.d:0 "The cowardly Kingdom of Stormwind has capitulated to the Orcish horde with barely a fight! Their lands lay in ruins, their armies are decimated and yet they crawl pitifuly to our doorstep begging for our aid! Though we have historically seen fairly eye to eye with [STO.GetLeader], not to mention Prince Arthas's friendship with Prince Varian, it seems almost preposterous that we should help them given what they've done."

 stormwind_capitulation.330.option.2:0 "End it all."

 stormwind_capitulation.110.t:0 "We have failed."
 stormwind_capitulation.110.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the city of Stormwind itself has been lost. King Llane Wrynn died heroically alongside the men and women of Stormwind's army in a last ditch attempt to stop the encroachment of the Orcish Horde on our land. It seems as though all is lost, we can only hope the Orcs show some uncharacteristic mercy."
