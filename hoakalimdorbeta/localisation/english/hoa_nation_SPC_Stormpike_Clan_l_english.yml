POLITICS_VANNDAR_STORMPIKE_WOW_DESC:0 "After the king of Khazmodan, Magni Bronzebeard, shifted the focus of his people from simply mining and engineering to archeology, several expeditions were sent to find out the truth about the legendary heritage of his people. Led by Vanndar Strompike, Clan Leader of the Stormpike Clan, the Stormpike Expedition was sent to the Alterac Valley to find natural resources and ancient Titan relics. The search for these artifacts takes them to the holy land of the Frostwolf clan, causing many conflicts between the two factions. No one knows exactly how the conflict broke out between the two factions, but since then, Vanndar and his forces are fighting against Drek'Thar, the leader of the Frostwolf clan, and his orcish warriors for the property of the valley. From his mountain fortress Dun Garok the mountain king Vanndar Stormpike oversees the events in Alterac. Until the Frostwolf Clan orcs are finally defeated, Vanndar Stormpike will find no rest until Alterac Valley is his."
