TSC_guldan:0 "Gul'dan"
POLITICS_GULDAN_SHADOW_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Born a cripple, cast out by his clan, denied salvation by the elements, Gul’dan’s anger and resentment for his own people made him the prime candidate for Kil’jaeden to use as an instrument to turn the orcs of Draenor into a weapon for the use of the Burning Legion. Gul’dan didn’t even need to be manipulated for this role. He had an immense hatred for his own people at how he was treated and betraying them for his lust of godhood promised to him. After destroying the elements of Draenor he set in motion the events that caused the formation of the horde, turning the many Shamans of the clans into warlocks, getting Blackhand appointed as the Warchief of the Horde and manipulated the destruction of the Draenei and the Ogre kingdoms. And then, Kil’jaeden stopped talking to him and Gul’dan was left alone with an ever increasing irritated Warchief and clans filled with blood thirsty orcs who would have his head as his usefulness had dried up. That was until a mysterious figure appeared before the shadow council promising a new lush word ripe for invasion and personally told Gul’dan of a location called ‘The Tomb of Sargeras’ a location with potetant fell energy. With his help Gul’dan was able to whip the Horde into action constructing a dark portal and with the help of the mysterious stranger, open the portal. Now Gul’dan with his shadow council wants to claim the new world and the secret it holds for himself, because if Kil’jaeden isn’t going to make him a god, he’ll do it proactively himself."
