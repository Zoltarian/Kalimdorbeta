POLITICS_CHOGALL_DESC:0 "Cho’gall, a master of the arcane, fel and shadow. A two head ogre from Highmaul with a high affinity for the arcane and an arrogance that the elite of Highmaul saw as a threat to their power. Cho’gall escaped Highmaul after a failed assassination attempt and vowed vengeance. In his quest for power, he found Gul’dan who saw his power lust and his natural affinity for arcane and Cho’gall became Gul’dan’s foremost warlock apprentice in the Shadow Council. When he worked for the Shadow Council he was ordered to investigate and deal with the community of exiled pale orcs, ones who reached too close to the void and thus were maddened by its effects. He rushed into the Underpale expecting a fight, but was surprised that these Pale orcs weren’t threatened by his intrusion, in fact they were pleased that they could spread their prophesy of the Hour of Twilight, when the universe would be consumed by the shadows. Cho’gall did not believe in this prophesy but he tricked the pale orcs that the horde would be a vital instrument in bringing about the Hour of Twilight and would lead them into the Horde to revel and slaughter in the name of the Void Lords forming a new clan called the Twilight’s Hammer, named after the prophecy. However, as he increased his knowledge in the power of shadows and now arriving on Azeroth, the voices calling from the void have become stronger. Deepening his knowledge about the shadows as the truth of the prophecy seems to become clearer and clearer to him."
