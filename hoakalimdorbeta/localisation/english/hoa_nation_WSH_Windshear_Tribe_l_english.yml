POLITICS_NOTT_CANDLE_EXTINGUISHER_DESC:0 "What is the biggest fear for a Kobold? Death? Humans? Well for the Windshear tribe it is one thing, the threat of having your candle extinguished and made unusable by Nott. Nott is a talented shaman with a deep understanding and connection with the winds. This made him a laughing stock from the other shaman as how was one supposed to light a candle with the wind? That was until they all either died from mysterious mining accidents, ostracised for the humiliation of not being able to light their candles, and exiled for going through candles at an astounding rate. All of this was Nott, however. He made those opposed to him work in darkness and succumb to accidents, he made them unable to light their candles and made seen weak to the rest of the tribe, and cut their candles in half making the tribe grow with ire and annoyance at their lack of proper candle care. Nott used these dirty handed tactics to gain power and continues using these tactics to keep his power ruling the kobolds through fear."
