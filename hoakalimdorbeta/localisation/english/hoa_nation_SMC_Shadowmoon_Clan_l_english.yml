POLITICS_NERZHUL_DESC:0 "Ner'zhul was born to the Shadowmoon Clan, during his youth he would make frequent visits to Auchindon. Later in life, he was well-respected and recieved by all of the orcish shamans and clans. It was because of this that Gul'dan had chosen him to lead the Horde. He brought together the Orcish Clans forming the Orcish Horde. He was manipulated by Kil'jaeden through visions of his mate which had died from the red pox outbreak caused by Gul'dan. Gul'dan was also taken as Ner'zhul's apprentice due to a story that Ner'zhul had fell for about Gul'dan's village being destroyed. After he had convinced the Horde to unite and slaughter the Draenei, he realized how pointless it was and went to Oshu'gun. It was here his mate, Rulkan, who told him he was being decieved. It was because this was going to return home only for the Shadowmoon Clan to have been taken over by Gul'dan and because of this he had sent a letter to Durotan warning him of Gul'dan's sinister plans, saving the Frostwolves from demonic corruption.
