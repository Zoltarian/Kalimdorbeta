POLITICS_ALIDEN_PERENOLDE_SYNDICATE_DESC:0 "After Alterac's betrayal of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Alliance's leaders discussed what should be done with the kingdom. While Aliden was the rightful heir, the king of Stromgarde disagreed on making him the new king. Terenas Menethil believed him to be an unfitting leader with no real experience. Terenas believed that a strong leader trusted by the Alliance leadership should be put in place as King of Alterac, and he declared Lord Prestor as his choice to take that position. Aliden Perenolde was told from an early age that he would succeed his father as Lord of Alterac City. He was just beginning to make a name for himself in court when the Alliance sacked the city for his father’s misdeeds. He claims that his father had ruined everything, for Aliden wanted to redeem their surname's reputation from his father's betrayal. As the leader of the Syndicate, his goal is to achieve his birthright and become king of Alterac."
