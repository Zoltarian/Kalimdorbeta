POLITICS_DEATHWING_DESC:0 "Formerly known as Neltharion, Deathwing rules over the Black Dragonflight as the Aspect of Death. Neltharion betrayed the other dragonflights at Zin-Azshari by taking the Dragon Soul and nearly obliterating the Blue Dragonflight with it. Yet this came at a cost, as Neltharion's being was warped into a cracking shell of magma and fire. Thus he became known as Deathwing the Destroyer. Now the Destroyer rests from his wounds, awaiting the moment to usher in a new age of chaos."
