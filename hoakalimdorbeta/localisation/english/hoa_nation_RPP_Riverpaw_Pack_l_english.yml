RPP_hogger:0 "Hogger"
POLITICS_HOGGER_DESC:0 "The Chieftain of the Riverpaw Pack. He is as ruthless as they come - as a Gnoll, he remembers the Gnoll Wars when the Gnolls nearly overran Azeroth. If Hogger has his way, it will happen again. The Scourge of Elwynn is a threat to the stability of the Kingdom of Stormwind - and if left unchecked, will see the Kingdom burnt to ashes around him. As the Riverpaw Pack prepares for war, Hogger knows that his time is coming soon. He simply needs to wait for Stormwind to make the first move."

RPP_clever_minds:0 "Clever Minds"
RPP_clever_minds_desc:0 "Hogger shows uncharacteristic intelligence for his species. Under his guidance, the Gnolls are capable of some impressive feats of industry - although they still cannot build their own!"
