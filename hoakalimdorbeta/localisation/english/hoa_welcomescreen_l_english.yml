 #"\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 15% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! includes a small number of new musical tracks. In order to allow the players to choose what kind of music they prefer, we have implemented a button in the §Ymusic player window§! (accessed by clicking the §Ynote symbol§! below §Ytime speed controls§!, and then the §Yleftmost button§!) allowing to choose between §Yboth Vanilla and EaW music§!, §Yonly Vanilla music§! and §Yonly EaW music§!.\n\nThe optional, but recommended £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War Music Mod§! supports this feature as well.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect."

Gul'dan chose §YChieftain Blackhand§!, the only orc he knew who possesed the strength and confidence to exert control over the various orc clans and to lead them to a swift victory. He would impose strict military discipline on the other orcs and would use their elemental forges to create armaments of war.\n\n Gul'Dan promised Blackhand that if he took up the mantle of §YWarchief§! his soldiers would become the mightiest of all the clans, that his shamans could use their powers again, and that he would become the greatest orc leader to have ever lived.\n\nGul'Dan trained some of Blackhand's orcs to control fel magic. He also taught them how to speed the growth of an orc into adolescence so that they could go to combat far quicker than normal.\n\nBlackhand was impressed and ordered the same to be done to his two sons: §YDal'Rend§! and §YMaim§!.\n\nBlackhand agreed to become Warchief and Gul'Dan gave Blackhand a seat on his §yShadow Council§!.\n\nShortly after, the chieftains and shamans of the orcs gathered at a gathering close to §gOshu'Gun§!. Here, Blackhand promoted the new source of power that Gul'Dan had taught his shamans.\n\nGul'Dan then convinced all the orcs that to ultimately bring the clans victory they needed to have a single military leader which everyone could stand united behind - §YBlackhand§!. And so Blackhand united all the orc clans under one banner: the Horde.\n\nWhile the war against the Draenei continued, Gul'Dan ordered the construction of the §gDark Portal§! and sought to bring the orcs to a new home.

Due to the two clans' close friendship, the Warsong orcs allowed the Burning Blade to remain in Nagrand while all of the other clans were forced out.\n\nThe Burning Blade joined the Old Horde along with most of the other orcish clans. 2 years before the First War, Kargath Bladefist was charged with eliminating the high arakkoa of Skyreach and formed a lightly armored but highly mobile invasion force from the Shattered Hand, Burning Blade and Dragonmaw clans.

Though there was no shortage of wild game, Tanaan was tremendously perilous, filled with Primals, poisonous plants and venomous animals. Furthermore, there were dark caves and hollows that seemed to vibrate with sinister, shadowy power. Sometimes the orcs who tapped into this essence found glory, but other times they found madness. Tanaan's orcs adopted a savage, superstitious mindset. Those who kept their sanity called themselves the Bleeding Hollow clan, while those who truly lost themselves to the dark impulses of the wilds were exiled and, over time, formed another, smaller clan known as the Bonechewers. The two clans were never allies, but were also rarely at war. The jungle was a dangerous enough enemy for both.\n\nThe alternate universe's Vault of Eyes contains at least 39 skulls of former Bleeding Hollow chieftains, as well as the skull of an unnamed mad chieftain and the ghosts of three former chieftains: Braknoth, Durmak and Vargrak.\n\nAround 11 years before the First War, the Bleeding Hollow dwelled in the remote corners of Tanaan and faced many threats, from botani and genesaur to ogres and arakkoa. These enemies pushed the clan to the brink of extinction, until Kilrogg Deadeye came to power by gouging out his eye and murdering his sickly father to take control of the ailing clan. Under his leadership, the orcs stormed through the jungles and eradicated their old enemies.\n\nShortly after Blackhand was named Warchief of the Horde, he assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Bleeding Hollow were among the clans assigned to act as scouts, raiders and auxiliary forces that could quickly move from one region of Draenor to another.\n\nLater, Kilrogg and the Bleeding Hollow launched a campaign into Farahlon, a lush island serving as the last bastion of the Primals and one of the few places on Draenor unsullied by fel magic. The forests there were dense, but Kilrogg and his followers were well adapted to fighting in such terrain. As the orcs were not seafarers, the orcish forces relied on ogre shipwrights to build vessels capable of crossing the ocean. Once in Farahlon, orc warlocks leeched life from the Primals and used the stolen power to set the forests ablaze while Kilrogg and his army slaughtered every botani and genesaur they could find.\n\n- Wowpedia"

He pressed his ideals of family and community on his three sons — Fenris, Ga'nar and Durotan — but Fenris later left the Frostwolves to instead join the rivaling Thunderlord clan, which he eventually rose to become the chieftain of. After Fenris' departure, Garad chose Durotan as his new heir apparent over the hotheaded Ga'nar, despite Ga'nar being the older of the two siblings. At some point, Ga'nar, Garad, and the warriors of the Frostwolf clan fought against the Laughing Skull clan.\n\nFor a number of months, tensions began to increase between the orc clans of Frostfire Ridge and the local Bladespire ogres. Imperator Kelgrok, troubled by the waning of ogre influence across Draenor, sought to retrain control of Frostfire and oversaw the creation of an army of half-orc, half-ogres known as the mok'nathal. The half-breeds formed the bulk of the Bladespire army as the ogres rampaged across Frostfire and seized large tracts of resource-rich land from the orcs. In response, Garad called upon the Whiteclaw and Thunderlord clans to unite with the Frostwolves against this new threat. Due to Fenris' influence, the Thunderlords rejected the call and instead dealt with the Bladespire in their own way, raiding settlements in the dead of night. The Whiteclaws, on the other hand, did join the Frostwolves, for whom they felt an affinity and with which they shared many customs and traditions. Garad was declared leader of the Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army and named Ga'nar and Durotan as his lieutenants. The orcs didn't win any decisive victories, but managed to capture several mok'nathal and their leader, Leoroxx. Upon learning from Leoroxx that the mok'nathal were slaves rather than willing servants, Garad and the half-breed elder agreed to help each other destroy the Bladespire forever. Leoroxx returned to Bladespire Hold and incited the mok'nathal to rebel against their masters while Garad and his army smashed into Bladespire Hold's outer defenses. The Battle of Bladespire concluded with the allied orc and mok'nathal armies driving the ogres from their fortress, with Imperator Kelgrok having been strangled by Leoroxx in the heart of the burning fortress. However, hundreds of Frostwolves and Whiteclaws had perished in the battle, including Ga'nar. His death broke Garad's heart, and though Durotan remained to carry on the family line, the Frostwolf chieftain never recovered from the loss of his second son. Garad offered the mok'nathal land in Frostfire, but Leoroxx declined and chose to instead settle his people in a remote corner of Gorgrond, knowing the orcs would never truly accept half-breeds.\n\nThe next year, many orcs contracted the virulent red pox at one of the Kosh'harg festivals in Nagrand, including Garad. At the shaman Ner'zhul's urging, the plague bearers remained in Nagrand to construct a village to quarantine the affected. The thought of not returning home filled Garad with sorrow, but he did not wish to spread the pox to his family and clan members and instead agreed to remain in Nagrand, taking charge over his fellow plague victims. Durotan volunteered to stay behind with his father, but as he was the sole remaining heir to the clan Garad instead told him to return home and look after the Frostwolves for the time being. In a matter of weeks, the red pox consumed Garad, and the other pox victims named their village Garadar in his honor.\n\nDuring the time of the rise of the Old Horde, the Frostwolves were one of the smaller orc clans, consisting of about eighty members.\n\n8 years before the First War, Chieftain Durotan, his mate Draka and the Frostwolf elder shaman Drek'Thar were present at Oshu'gun when Ner'zhul announced the draenei as enemies of the orcs and where nearly every chieftain agreed to unite into a single Horde. Durotan felt conflicted about Ner'zhul's claim that the spirits had told him the draenei were planning to destroy the orcish race, but the Frostwolf chieftain was in no position to question the ancestral spirits. Additionally, other shaman, including Drek'Thar, revealed that they had received similar visions that confirmed Ner'zhul's claims. Two years later, the Whiteclaw chieftain Zagrel was assassinated under the orders of the warlock Gul'dan for speaking out against the Horde. Gul'dan feared that Zagrel could win the support of orcs who questioned the Horde, like Durotan and his Frostwolves. Durotan was already wary of the Horde's war against the draenei, and the Whiteclaw chieftain's death caused his unease to deepen, yet he had no proof of who had murdered Zagrel. The next year, Gul'dan called for a new meeting at Oshu'gun, where he revealed that the shaman of the Blackrock clan had mastered a new power known as fel magic after the elements had abandoned the orcs. Powerless shaman from all clans, including Drek'Thar, pleaded with the Blackrocks to share their fel secrets. Despite his suspicions about the fel, Durotan gave his permission to the shaman to study this new magic, as he would not allow his clan to be put in a place of weakness. Durotan also begrudgingly voted for the Blackrock chieftain Blackhand as the first Warchief of the Horde along with the other chieftains, since he feared that his clan would face dire consequences from the Blackrocks if he were the only voice of dissent.\n\nShortly after his appointment as Warchief, Blackhand assigned specific roles to the various clans. The Frostwolves were among the clans that would make up the Horde's main fighting force, leading direct assaults on draenei settlements and forming the backbone of the orcish army. Shortly afterward, Blackhand sent his most powerful warlocks to the other orc clans in order to imbue adolescents with the strength and fury of adults. The thought of subjecting young Frostwolves to the warlocks' strange magics unsettled Durotan, but Blackhand had made it clear that anyone who opposed him would suffer, and the Frostwolf chieftain placed the safety of his clan above all else. Thus, he reluctantly allowed the warlocks to imbue his clan's youths with fel magic to transform them into hulking warriors. Durotan was also troubled by the fact that the orcs' brown skin had begun to slowly turn splotchy green, which he correctly suspected was due to the warlocks' magic. However, none of the other orcs were troubled by this physical change.\n\nTwo years later, Ner'zhul — a captive of Gul'dan — planted an anonymous missive to Durotan where he urged the Frostwolf chieftain to not follow Gul'dan's command at an upcoming clan gathering, or he and his people would suffer a fate worse than death. Durotan heeded the warning, and when the other orcs drank the Blood of Mannoroth atop a mountain near the Horde capital, the Frostwolf chieftain refused to participate and forbade his clan from drinking. Gul'dan was already suspicious of Durotan and was infuriated by his defiance, but could not afford killing him and upsetting the Frostwolves due to the impending assault on Shattrath City.\n\nAfter Shattrath's fall, Warchief Blackhand tasked the Frostwolf, Whiteclaw and Thunderlord clans with wiping out Draenor's gronn, ogron and magnaron, as well as the ogres that had refused to join the Horde. The Frostwolves and Whiteclaws saw no honor in hunting the giants down and held most of their warriors back, but the Thunderlords did not shy away from the task and reveled in the slaughter of their ancient enemies.\n\nDuring the construction of the Dark Portal, Blackhand staged mock battles and duels to prepare for the impending invasion of Azeroth. Durotan saw this practice as a disgrace to tradition and began speaking out against Gul'dan and fel magic, urging the orcs to seek ways to heal their world. Most clans saw these actions as cowardly and treasonous and lashed out at the Frostwolves.\n\n- Wowpedia"

They reveled in the powers of the Void that leaked from the injured naaru K'ure, and through the Void they communed with the void lords that sought to bring about an end to all existence. The Pale orcs' dark power rivaled even fel magic in potency, and rumors of the Pale and their otherworldly abilities eventually reached Gul'dan. Though he paid little heed to the stories, his master, the eredar lord Kil'jaeden, was intrigued. Because Kil'jaeden pressed Gul'dan to ensure victory over the draenei at any cost, that meant investigating the Pale to determine if their magic could strengthen the Horde. Gul'dan sent his apprentice Cho'gall to investigate the Pale, and if they proved as mighty as the rumors claimed, to bring them into the Horde.\n\nCho'gall stormed into the Underpale expecting a fight, but found none. The Pale did not resist his intrusion for they were eager to share their prophecy of doom: the Hour of Twilight, a time when the shadow would envelop the universe and snuff out all life in existence. Cho'gall had little interest in their prophecy but was very interested in their unfamiliar shadow magic. To win the Pale over, Cho'gall used their beliefs to his advantage and claimed that Horde was a weapon by which they could bring about the Hour of Twilight. The Pale reveled in the opportunity to serve as agents of the apocalypse. They committed themselves to the Horde and formed a new clan: the Twilight's Hammer clan.\n\nAs he too learned to master shadow magic, Cho'gall would see the truth in the Pale's prophecy. It would take him many years, but he would eventually devote himself to their quest.\n\nObsessed with the notion that the Horde was the harbinger of apocalyptic doom to all the lands that it ravages, the Twilight's Hammer felt a sacrosanct gratification in the destruction of all that it encountered. Led by the cunning ogre mage Cho'gall, the Twilight's Hammer had strong ties to Gul'dan and the Stormreaver clan. Its loyalty to the Horde was not as strong as its belief in its sacred mission of oblivion.\n\n- Wowpedia"

To this end, he promoted a public figurehead, Blackhand of the Blackrock clan to the new position of Warchief. Though Blackhand was cunning, he lacked the loyalty to Kil'jaeden and deviousness needed to drive the Horde. Thus, Gul'dan secretly brought together a collection of warlocks, necrolytes, chieftains, and even the occasional ogre into a clandestine council — the Shadow Council.\n\nThe original purpose of the Council was to ensure the stability of the Horde in their quest to destroy the draenei, manipulate the clans and spread the use of warlock magics. When the time came, the Shadow Council fed the blood of Mannoroth to the clans, apart from the Frostwolf clan (whose chieftain, Durotan, forbade them from partaking) and a few other individuals.\n\nThe Council made their headquarters at the Black Temple and oversaw the destruction of the draenei until Kil'jaeden mysteriously vanished. As the Horde began to fragment, the Shadow Council was contacted by Medivh, who offered a new world to plunder.\n\n- Wowpedia"

As §YStormwind§! expanded, §GGnoll§! packs who had inhabitated the region already began to raid small towns and convoys.

He gambled on eliminating the §YGnoll Packlord§!, §RGarfang§!, while the Gnolls besieged §YStormwind§!. It was a bold and risky maneuver, as Barathen could only take a small force to avoid detection. After rushing to the §gRedridge Mountains§!, Barathen located §RGarfang§! with only a small personal guard.\n\nThe two respective leaders clashed in a battle that lasted hours until §YBarathen§! finally struck §RGarfang§!'s neck, killing the packlord. With no time to rest, Barathen gathered what knights he still had and raced back toward §YStormwind§!. Under Barathen's leadership, the Gnolls were repelled from the city before breaking apart and turning on one another. §YStormwind§! had won.\n\nFor his heroic efforts, §YBarathen§! would be known as 'the Adamant,' as he continued to lead Stormwind into prosperity. Having won the war on their own, the people of Stormwind shared in the ideals of independence and self-reliance - causing the kingdom to become isolationist."
