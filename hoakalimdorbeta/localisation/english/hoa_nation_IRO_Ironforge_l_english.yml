POLITICS_MAGNI_BRONZEBEARD_DESC:0 "200 years after the demise of Highking Modimus Anvilmar and the War of the Three Hammers, the Bronzebeard clan, former ruled by Thane Madoran Bronzebeard, stood as the traditional defenders and rulers of Ironforge Mountain. Born as the eldest of the three brothers of the Bronzebeard clan, Magni was destined to become the king of the dwarven kingdom of Khaz Modan. Since his youth, Magni knew what would be expected of him. Intimidated of the thought ruling over the dwarven people, he questioned himself, if he is even suited to lead his nation into a new future. After his father's early death, Magni took upon his crown and became the Ruler of Khaz Modan. As the new king of Ironforge, Magni helped in founding the famed “Explorers’ League” and brought his people from simply mining and engineering to archaeology."
