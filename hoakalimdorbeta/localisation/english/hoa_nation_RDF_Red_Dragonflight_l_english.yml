RDF_alexstraza:0 "Alexstraza"
POLITICS_ALEXSTRAZA_DESC:0 "Alexstrazsa the 'Life-Binder' is the Aspect of Life and Queen of Dragons. She leads the Red Dragonflight in a state of relative peace however she is locked in constant debate with her kin over the rising mortal races. Many suggest purging them in an effort to preserve Azeroth, while others including Alexstraza see it more fit to nurture and teach them."
POLITICS_ALEXSTRAZA_ENSLAVED_DESC:0 "The Queen of Dragons is enslaved. Having sought for the Demon Soul, formerly known as the Dragon Soul, Alexstraza fell into a trap orchestrated by Deathwing. Now she is forced to obey the Dragonmaw Orcs by laying eggs - future slaves for the Dragonmaw. Bound in adamantine steel, there is little hope for Alexstraza to escape her captors less the full fury of the Demon Soul be used against her and her dragonflight."
