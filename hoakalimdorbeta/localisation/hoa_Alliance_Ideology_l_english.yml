 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level1:0 "Alliance Bureaucracy: Chaotic"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level1_desc:0 "Our bureaucracy is in a state of chaos, whether through negligence or corruption. If we are to be prepared for the times to come, we must rectify this concern."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level2:0 "Alliance Bureaucracy: Disorganised"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level2_desc:0 "Though somewhat improved, our bureaucracy is still in desperate need of repair and reorganisation. We cannot let mere paperwork be the reason we are felled by the forces of darkness."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level3:0 "Alliance Bureaucracy: Mediocre"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level3_desc:0 "Though it has been an arduous task, we can now safely state that our bureaucracy is no longer a hinderance to our operations. But it has yet to become a strength..."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level4:0 "Alliance Bureaucracy: Efficient"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level4_desc:0 "To think that paper pushers could accomplish so much! It is a wonder to behold when everything runs on schedule and under budget. Yet they assure us there is further yet to go."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level5:0 "Alliance Bureaucracy: Masterful"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Level5_desc:0 "As our warriors effortlessly draw their blades on instinct, so too do the pens of our bureaucrats sign the dotted lines on crucial orders and logistics. we have truly achieved the impossible, a bureaucracy that is an actual benefit to the nation!"

 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade1to2:0 "Remove Incompentent Officers"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade1to2_desc:0 "Layabouts, Nepotists, Charletans and Thieves. These and other miscreants have found their way into our governmental bodies and frequently cause problems through either ineptitude or greed. They must be removed."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade2to3:0 "Centralize Authoritative Hierarchies"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade2to3_desc:0 "Who is taking orders from who? At the moment, we don't actually know. This absurd state of affairs cannot continue, as one paper pusher overrules another based on archaic laws from generations past or patently absurd technicalities. There must be a clear hierarchy of command, even within the civil service."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade3to4:0 "Enforce Linguistic Standards"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade3to4_desc:0 "Though we've removed the core issues at the heart of our civil service, a clear and obvious problem remains: A lack of a single language and writing dialect. This lack of writing standardization has frequently resulted in critical miscommunications and must be corrected and rigidly enforced if we are to ensure our vast bureaucratic machine can properly communicate with itself across our territory."
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade4to5:0 "An Effective Bureaucracy?"
 Alliance_Bureaucracy_Upgrade4to5_desc:0 "Is it possible to actually make the bureaucracy serve the needs of the state better than the needs of the bureaucrats? Some of them claim such a thing to be possible, and though there are many detractors to the radical reforms they propose, these changes could bear substantial fruit."

 Alliance_Bureaucractic_Upgrade:0 "Bureaucratic Reformation"
 Alliance_Bureaucractic_Upgrade_desc:0 "Our Bureaucracy is in need of repair and reformating, lest it serve as a detriment to us in these troubled times. With a substantial investment of time and political capital, we can see to the enhancement of our otherwise troubled bureaucracy, improve its effectiveness, and even perhaps make it less irritating to deal with, although many of our advisors assure us this third goal is simply impossible."

 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level1:0 "Prepare Supply Stockpiles"
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level1_desc:0 "War is coming to our lands. We must make ready for the coming tides of darkness, lest we run out of crucial supplies in our darkest hour."
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level2:0 "Demand Construction Materials"
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level2_desc:0 "Though it will disrupt the flow of goods in our nation for a time, the benefits of hoarding away construction materials will ensure we do not run dry at a critical moment."
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level3:0 "Seize Additional Construction Equipment"
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level3_desc:0 "Seizure of private property and business materials will be deeply unpopular with the peasantry. Yet to survive the coming onslaught, we can afford to anger our citizens. Poverty is preferable to death, after all..."
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level4:0 "Relocate Stone Masons"
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level4_desc:0 "We cannot continue to rely on our disorganised private enterprises to serve the needs of our nation during these times of war.

 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level5:0 "Construct Secret Workshops"
 Alliance_Supply_Appropriation_Level5_desc:0 "No mater how much territory we lose, we cannot permit our enemies to steal from us our chances to revive our great nation. A network of secret workshops dotted around our lands will permit us to continue to function efficiently, even when the bleakest of days befall us."

 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level1_desc:0 "Public funding must be disbursed to various enterprises that can provide the state with the crucial military equipment it requires. To run short of swords in a time of war would be a travesty without equal."
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level2:0 "Purchase More Smithing Equipment"
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level2_desc:0 "We must use more of our funding to acquire additional tools for our smiths. The drums of war beat ever louder, and we must be ready, lest we be swallowed by the darkness."
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level3:0 "Seize Ore Supplies"
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level3_desc:0 "Though we may have promised our people that much of the nations resources will be provided to them, we can longer afford to be as generous as we have been.

 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level4:0 "Relocate the Smiths"
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level4_desc:0 "The forces of darkness have their sights set upon our lush lands and bountiful towns.

 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level5:0 "Construct Secret Smithies"
 Alliance_Smithy_Appropriation_Level5_desc:0 "Regardless of how far they push into our lands, we cannot permit our enemies to steal from us our ability to retaliate against them.
