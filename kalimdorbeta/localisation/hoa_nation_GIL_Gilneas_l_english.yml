POLITICS_GENN_GREYMANE_DESC:0 "The king of Gilneas. Prideful, distrustful and strongly independent, he leads Gilneas in much the same way. Not eager to throw the forces of Gilneas into any conflict and a skeptic of the existence of these so called ‘orcs’, the idea of the Alliance is one that Genn isn’t very keen on. Even so his own pride does not stop him from doing what is right for his people and their survival."
