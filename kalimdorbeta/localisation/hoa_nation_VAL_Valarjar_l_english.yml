POLITICS_ODYN_DESC:0 "Caught in the Halls of Valor, the titan Keeper Odyn rules over this realm. As one of the Keepers chosen by the Pantheon, Odyn led the army of the titan-forged against the forces of the Old Gods. It was Odyn, with the help of Tyr, who defeated the mighty Fire Lord Ragnaros. It was also Odyn who, with his glorious plan, overthrown the mighty Old God Yogg-Sauron. After the war between the Titans and the ancient gods, Odyn was ordered by the Pantheon to guard the prison of Yogg-Saron and the Forge of Wills. When the other Keepers had decided to ask the Pantheon to empower the dragon aspects for their heroism in the fight against Galakrond, the dragon's forefather, Odyn was vehemently against it, declaring that only the titan-forged can secure the defense of Azeroth. The aspects were strengthened despite his objections, and so Odyn took a part of Ulduar, lifted this to heaven and created the Halls of Valor. With his new realm, he promised the vrykul that those who died a dignified death in the battle would bring their spirits into these halls and supply new immortal bodies with the power of the storm to fight as his Valarjar which Odyn thought were a better defenders than the dragons. After the Vrykul refused to take the souls of the deceased vrykul out of the Shadowlands, Helya, Odyn's adopted daughter, became the first Val'kyr to take on this task without reserve. Thousands of years later, Helya, who was persuaded by Loken, turned against Odyn and bound him to the Halls of Valor with the same magic she used to seal the elemental plain and founded her own realm Helheim. Caught and with no sight of salvation, Odyn rules the Halls of Valor, waiting for true heroes to test their might."
