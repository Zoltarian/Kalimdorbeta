Zuluhed has pledged his clan to Blackhand personally, after facing severe hard times with the wasting of Draenor that forced his clan to eat and hunt their own Rylaks to extinction for survival."
POLITICS_ZULUHED_THE_WHACKED_SECOND_WAR_DESC:0 "Chieftain of the Dragonmaw clan. Famed for their ability to domestic the native flying beasts the Rylaks back in Draenor. After facing severe hard times with the wasting of Draenor, they ate and hunted their own Rylaks to extinction and threw all their weight behind the Azeroth idea to hope for a new home. After Blackhand's death, the Dragonmaw pledged their allegiance to the Rend and Maim Blackhand. Now Zuluhed is hearing whispers. Whispers of a powerful artifact hidden in the Redridge mountains and a promise that it’ll let the Dragonmaw claim the skies once again."
