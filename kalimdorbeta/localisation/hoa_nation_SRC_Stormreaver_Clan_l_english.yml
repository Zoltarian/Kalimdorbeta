POLITICS_GULDAN_STORMREAVER_CLAN_DESC:0 "Awakened from his coma after scrying the guardians mind for the location of the tomb of sargeras, Gul’dan awoke to a much different Horde then he had left behind. Stormwind had fallen to the Horde, but the Shadow Council and Blackhand were no more. All he had left was Cho’gall and no one trusted Gul’dan anymore. But that’s when the voice of Kil'jaeden returned to him and told him to help this new horde anyway he could. After a horde wide ban on the fel magic, Gul’dan and Cho’gall worked together to make Azeroth's first order of Death Knights. However, unbeknownst to Kil'jaeden and Doomhammer is that Gul’dan had found out the location of the Tomb of Sargeras and now was biding his time to escape the grasps of the new Horde and get into the tomb to unlock whatever power is hidden inside."

We have been warned a more closetful eye will be kept on us and many of the orcs assigned to this new clan will be loyal to Doomhammer. All is not lost however, small amounts of the Shadow Council, and new arrivals from the Shadowmoon and Draenor will make up a good portion of the clan and will prove loyal to you should you ever need them."
