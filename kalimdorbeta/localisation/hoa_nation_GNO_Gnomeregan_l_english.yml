POLITICS_GELBIN_MEKKATORQUE_DESC:0 "Gelbin Mekkatorque is the elected High Tinker of Gnomergan. From his graduation from Gearshaft university he flung himself into the gnomish public eye with his invention of the Mechanostrider which allowed the small sized gnomes to be on par on speed with humanity and their chargers. Each of Gelbin's inventions seem to increase his status and popularity in Gnomergan. These inventions included the Gyromatic micro-adjuster, the Repair bot and would also come to include the technical marvels of the Deeprun Tram and the Dwarven Siege Engine. His inventive prowess was loved by the gnomes to the point that they public elected him to be the High Tinker where to this day he continues his role of leading the gnomes of Gnomergan into a new era of technological ingenuity and, unbeknownst to him, a new era for Azeroth."
